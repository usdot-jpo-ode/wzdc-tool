05-31-2018 CVMsgBuilder v1.4

The following are instructions for updating the standard J2735 ASN.1 file
(J2735_201603DA.asn) to include support for the RoadsideSafetyMessage.

Applications decoding UPER PDUs generated by CVMsgBuilder v1.4 must include
the following changes to the standard J2735 ASN.1 schema. Three lines must
be added.
 
For each, the previous (existing) line from the J2735 ASN.1 file is shown,
followed by the new line to be added.
 
The first two changes occur in the DSRC module:
 
   { PersonalSafetyMessage IDENTIFIED BY personalSafetyMessage } |  
   { RSM.RoadsideSafetyMessage IDENTIFIED BY roadsideSafetyMessage } |   
   
   
   personalSafetyMessage             DSRCmsgID ::=   32 -- PSM
   roadsideSafetyMessage             DSRCmsgID ::=   33 -- RSM
   
The third change occurs in the REGION module:
   
Reg-PersonalSafetyMessage  DSRC.REG-EXT-ID-AND-TYPE ::= { ... }
Reg-RoadsideSafetyMessage  DSRC.REG-EXT-ID-AND-TYPE ::= { ... }

Be sure to include the rsmv5.1.asn file (contains the RSM module) to the
list of included files within your ASN.1 compiler environment and recompile.
